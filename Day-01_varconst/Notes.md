# 📘 Introduction to C++

## 🧠 What is C++?
C++ is a **general-purpose**, **object-oriented** programming language that was developed as an extension of the C language by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in **1979**.

It combines the **power of C** with **features of object-oriented programming** (OOP) like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## 🧾 Basic Structure of a C++ Program

```cpp
#include <iostream>      // Header file for input-output
using namespace std;     // Standard namespace

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!";  // Output statement
    return 0;                 // Exit the program
}
```
